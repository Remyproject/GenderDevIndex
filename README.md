Gender Development Index (1990â€“2021)- A Data Driven Exploration

In the world of data, some stories are not just numbers; they're narratives that unfold over time. As a seasoned data analyst passionate about unraveling complex stories hidden within datasets, I embarked on a journey through the Gender Development Index (GDI) dataset. This dataset is a treasure trove of historical data, offering insights into gender disparities and human development across the globe. Join me as I navigate the data, uncovering patterns and painting a data-driven narrative.

Analysis 1: Continental Insights
I began by exploring gender development by continent. Europe led the way with an impressive average GDI of 0.99, while Africa faced substantial challenges with the lowest average GDI at 0.91. These regional disparities are significant.

Analysis 2: Mapping HDI Ranks (2021)
I visualized countries' HDI ranks 2021 by continent and human development groups. This map vividly showcased the global diversity in human development.

Analysis 3: A Holistic View
I combined vital indicators - the sum of the Gender Development Index (GDI), minimum HDI rank in 2021, and maximum HDI rank in 2021 - offering a comprehensive perspective on development dynamics.

Analysis 4: Hemispheric Insights
I ventured into hemispheric analysis, revealing variations in HDI rank among countries with different levels of human development.

My journey through the Gender Development Index dataset highlights the importance of data in understanding and addressing gender disparities. Pursuing gender equality is ongoing, and data is our guiding light.
